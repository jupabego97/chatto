# FDR-021: Admin Dashboard & System Monitoring

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-06

## Overview

The admin section gives owners and admins visibility into the server's operational state: user counts, room counts, storage resource usage, projection health, and audit/event-log diagnostics. It deliberately exposes operational metadata — never message content, never per-user activity logs, never per-room conversation summaries.

## Behavior

- The admin UI lives under `/chat/[serverId]/server-admin/`. Non-admins see an "access denied" panel; the link is hidden from the chat header for them.
- **Users page** — paginated list of all server members with login, email, roles, verification status. Admins can edit profiles, assign roles, suspend, or delete users (subject to outranking the target — see FDR-001).
- **System Info page** — owner-only page showing backing message-broker connection status, storage account limits and current usage, stream/consumer health, projection health (lag, entry counts, and rough memory estimates), and `admin.systemInfo.stats` (user count, channel room count, DM room count).
- **Audit log page** — chronological diagnostic event-log view for forensic review. The list view uses `admin.eventLog`; the detail view uses `admin.eventLogEntry` to show the raw payload JSON for human inspection.
- The audit/event-log GraphQL connection returns `totalCount` as `Int64` because it reflects retained stream message counts, which can exceed GraphQL's 32-bit `Int` range on long-running servers.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Capability-based admin entry

**Decision:** There is no separate `admin.access` permission. The admin UI is visible when the viewer has at least one concrete admin capability, while child routes and GraphQL fields enforce their own narrower gates such as `server.manage`, `admin.view-users`, `admin.view-audit`, `role.manage`, and owner-only diagnostics.
**Why:** Some operators want a "read-only admin" role that can investigate without making changes; some want users-but-not-system access for a customer-support persona. Tiered permissions let those roles be expressed without inventing parallel role systems.
**Tradeoff:** There is no standalone "can see the admin dashboard" bit. The dashboard is a capability index, so the UI derives visibility from the concrete permissions the viewer holds.

### 2. Operational metadata, not conversation content

**Decision:** The System Info page can expose operational metadata such as stream/consumer state and projection diagnostics, but not message bodies, file contents, per-user activity trails, or per-room conversation summaries.
**Why:** Operators need enough detail to diagnose lag, storage pressure, and projection growth. Those are system-health questions, not moderation questions. Keeping content and behavioral surveillance out of the admin dashboard preserves the privacy boundary while still making the server operable.
**Tradeoff:** Some identifiers and subject filters are visible to admins with system access. That is acceptable for the operator persona, but any future content-level moderation surface should be a separate, explicit feature.

### 3. Privacy boundary: admins see metadata, not content

**Decision:** Admins can see who exists, what rooms exist, who's a member, who has which roles. They cannot see message content, private messages, file contents, or user passwords.
**Why:** "Operate the system" and "read user conversations" are different jobs. Conflating them would mean every operator needs the trust level of a moderator with access to every conversation. Keeping the boundary explicit lets owners hire operators without granting message visibility.
**Tradeoff:** Moderation tools that need to read content (rare cases) would need a separate, auditable feature with explicit consent. None exists today.

### 4. Live data, not cached

**Decision:** System Info fetches fresh data from NATS and projection diagnostics on every page load. No caching layer.
**Why:** The data is fundamentally point-in-time ("how much storage are we using right now?"). Caching would mean stale numbers shown to operators making capacity decisions. The fetch cost is low because NATS already has the data internally.
**Tradeoff:** Refreshing the page hits NATS every time. Not a concern at admin-usage volume.

### 5. Diagnostic values are operator tooling, not product contracts

**Decision:** Raw storage subjects, stream/consumer names, payload JSON, projection metric names, and memory estimates are documented as diagnostic values. The GraphQL fields are intentional operator APIs, but clients should not parse those raw values as stable product-domain data.
**Why:** Operators need visibility into what the runtime is doing, especially during the 0.1 stabilization lane. At the same time, these values reflect storage and projection implementation details that may evolve as the event-sourcing model settles.
**Tradeoff:** Third-party admin clients can display diagnostics but should treat raw strings and JSON as best-effort inspection data. If a future integration needs a stable audit export format, it should get a dedicated schema instead of depending on diagnostic payloads.

### 6. Nested `admin` resolver with field-specific capability gates

**Decision:** Admin queries are grouped under a nested `Query.admin` type that returns for authenticated viewers, while sensitive fields check their own capabilities (`server.manage`, `admin.view-users`, `admin.view-system`, `admin.view-audit`, `role.manage`, owner-only diagnostics) before returning data.
**Why:** The nested shape gives the API one obvious admin-tooling namespace, and the field-level checks let operators delegate user, system, audit, and RBAC-editor visibility independently.
**Tradeoff:** A user may be able to enter the admin area but see permission denials or empty panels for specific sections. The UI has to reflect that capability split clearly.

## Permissions

- `admin.view-users` — gates user-management views, admin-only affordances, and user-sensitive fields such as other users' verified email addresses and login cooldowns. The underlying `server.members` directory query remains authenticated-user visible; see FDR-025.
- `admin.view-system` — gates `admin.projections`; `admin.systemInfo` is owner-only for now.
- `admin.view-audit` — gates `admin.eventLog` and `admin.eventLogEntry`.
- `role.assign` — gates user edits and role changes via the `requireUserAdminTarget` helper (permission + outrank-target check).

## Open Questions

- A more sensitive operator-only surface for raw storage inspection or content moderation would need its own permission and audit model. Not currently planned.
