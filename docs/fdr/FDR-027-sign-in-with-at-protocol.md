# FDR-027: Sign in with AT Protocol

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-05-19

## Overview

Users can sign in to Chatto using their AT Protocol identity — a DID issued by their PDS (typically `bsky.social`, but any compliant PDS works). The sign-in flow is offered alongside password and OIDC on the standard login page; once authentication completes, the resulting Chatto account behaves identically to one created by any other path. The intent is "unified identity": the same person signing in to two Chatto servers with the same ATProto handle is recognizable as the same person, without any federation between the servers.

## Behavior

- The login page shows a **Sign in with AT Protocol** form whenever the server has `[auth.atproto] enabled = true`. The form takes a single input — an ATProto handle (e.g. `alice.bsky.social`, `hendrik.mans.de`) — and a Continue button. A leading `@` is tolerated.
- Submitting the form redirects the browser to the user's PDS for the standard OAuth approval screen. After approval, the PDS redirects back to Chatto's callback endpoint.
- **First sign-in creates a Chatto account.** The user's DID is recorded as the stable identifier. Their handle is used to derive the Chatto login (so `alice.bsky.social` arrives as login `alice.bsky.social`). On collision with an existing Chatto login, a numeric suffix is appended (`-2`, `-3`, …).
- **First sign-in also seeds profile data.** Chatto reads the `app.bsky.actor.profile` record from the user's PDS and copies their display name and avatar into the new Chatto profile. The profile data is owned locally thereafter — Chatto does not re-sync from the PDS on later sign-ins.
- **Users without a Bluesky profile degrade gracefully.** A handle that has never used the `app.bsky.actor.profile` lexicon (e.g. a Frontpage-only user) signs in successfully; their Chatto display name defaults to their handle and they get the standard initial-letter avatar placeholder.
- **Subsequent sign-ins match by DID, not handle.** Handles can change at the protocol level; the DID is stable. The user's handle is re-resolved on each sign-in for display purposes but isn't used to identify them.
- **Email is requested but optional.** The sign-in flow asks for the `account:email` scope alongside the base `atproto` scope. If the user grants it on the PDS consent screen and their PDS-side email is confirmed, the address is added to the Chatto account as a verified email — which also triggers `owners.emails` owner auto-promotion through the shared verified-email hook. If the user declines the scope, sign-in still succeeds; the user simply lands without an email and can add one later through email management.
- **No ATProto credentials are retained.** Once the callback has identified the user, Chatto revokes the OAuth session immediately. Chatto does not store ATProto tokens and cannot act on the user's behalf against their PDS.
- **The resulting Chatto session is identical to any other.** Cookie + bearer token issued per FDR-023; from this point on the sign-in path is invisible to the rest of the application.

## Design Decisions

### 1. DID as the stable foreign key, handle as cached display

**Decision:** Store the user's DID as the primary link between an ATProto identity and a Chatto account. Re-resolve the handle on every sign-in for display purposes; don't persist it as an identity.
**Why:** Handles in ATProto can change (a user can move from `alice.bsky.social` to `alice.example.com` without losing their identity). The DID is the protocol's stable identifier. Persisting the handle as identity would silently break re-sign-in after a handle change.
**Tradeoff:** A handle-change between sign-ins means the user's Chatto login is stale until they update it through the normal rename flow. Acceptable — the alternative (renaming Chatto logins automatically on each sign-in) would be surprising and could cause its own confusion.

### 2. Handle-derived login with collision suffixing

**Decision:** On first sign-in, the Chatto login is derived from the ATProto handle directly (after lowercase + truncation to the existing 32-char login limit). On collision, suffix `-2`, `-3`, …, up to `-100`.
**Why:** Handles are already public, unique-within-PDS identifiers — perfect login material. Forcing the user to pick a fresh Chatto login at signup would be extra friction for no gain.
**Tradeoff:** A user whose preferred handle collides with an existing Chatto login lands with `-2` appended; they can fix it via the standard rename flow. Better than a forced disambiguation prompt at signup.

### 3. Request `account:email` and gracefully handle denial

**Decision:** Sign-in requests both `atproto` and `account:email`. On the PDS consent screen the user can grant or deny each scope independently. If `account:email` is granted and the PDS-side email is confirmed, Chatto seeds the new account's verified-email list with it. If it's denied (or the email is unconfirmed, or the fetch fails), sign-in still succeeds — the user simply has no email on their Chatto account.
**Why:** Email is what makes `owners.emails` auto-promotion work uniformly across all sign-in paths (password, OIDC, ATProto). Without it, an operator listing an owner's ATProto-side email gets nothing. The consent screen is honest — the user sees that the email is being asked for and can refuse without losing access.
**Tradeoff:** The consent screen now lists two scopes instead of one, which is a touch more friction. Users who decline the email scope land with no `owners.emails` eligibility and no email-based notifications until they add one manually; that's their explicit choice, not Chatto's omission.

### 4. Profile mirroring on first sign-in only

**Decision:** Read `app.bsky.actor.profile` from the user's PDS once, on first sign-in, and copy display name + avatar into the Chatto profile. Don't re-sync on later sign-ins. Failures are logged and swallowed.
**Why:** Users expect their Chatto profile edits to stick — silently overwriting them on the next sign-in would be hostile. The first-sign-in copy gives ATProto users a head start (recognizable avatar, real name) instead of a blank-slate account; further changes are theirs to manage. Failure-as-silence handles users on PDSes without a bsky profile record (Frontpage, WhiteWind, …) without breaking sign-in.
**Tradeoff:** A user who changes their Bluesky display name won't see it propagate to Chatto. Considered correct — Chatto isn't a Bluesky mirror.

### 5. No ATProto tokens persist past sign-in

**Decision:** Revoke the OAuth session at the end of the callback. Store nothing.
**Why:** Phase 1 has no "act on the user's PDS" feature, so the tokens are pure attack surface. See ADR-032 for the general principle covering all external identity providers.
**Tradeoff:** Any future feature that needs to write to a user's PDS will have to do its own separate OAuth flow with its own scopes. Considered correct — those use cases deserve their own consent moment anyway.

### 6. ATProto sign-in only works at publicly-reachable or loopback URLs

**Decision:** The OAuth client uses `webserver.url` directly. When that URL is `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` (any port), the loopback dev-mode escape hatch kicks in; otherwise the deployment URL must be publicly reachable so the PDS can fetch the client metadata document. There is no third option.
**Why:** The constraint is baked into the ATProto OAuth spec. Encoding it directly in `webserver.url` matches how the rest of the codebase derives URLs and keeps the configuration surface minimal.
**Tradeoff:** Dev deployments on `*.orb.local`-style local-only hostnames can't use ATProto sign-in; operators have to either deploy publicly or develop against a loopback URL. The current `mise dev` setup uses loopback by default, so this is invisible to most local development.

## Open Questions

- Whether to define a `run.chatto.*` lexicon for Chatto-specific profile data on the user's PDS (cross-server discovery, "find me on these other Chatto servers"). Out of scope for Phase 1.
- Account linking: today, a user with both a Chatto password account and an ATProto handle that resolves to the same person ends up with two separate Chatto accounts. A future settings-page action could merge them on explicit consent.
